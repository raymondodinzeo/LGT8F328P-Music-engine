# LGT8F328P-Music-engine
LGT8F328P Larduino.  Code creates a sample based sawtooth waveform which can be manipulated with an array containing note  
numbers and duration currently will play any tune that does not contain rests.
For an excellent tutorial to get the LGT8F328P working, go to url: https://github.com/RalphBacon/LGT8F328P-Arduino-Clone-Chip-ATMega328P
For version 0_2, a new tune. Programme has added rests and a facility to slur notes also a small change to make sure notes end with zero amplitude.
